// NOTE: This test is disabled (renamed to .skip) because it imports the main app
// which uses package:web (web-specific packages like dart:js_interop). These packages
// are not available when running Flutter tests on the VM platform.
//
// The test can be re-enabled if either:
// 1. The main app is refactored to use conditional imports for web-specific code
// 2. Widget tests are run with the Chrome platform: flutter test --platform chrome
//
// For now, API service tests in test/services/ provide sufficient coverage.

// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.
